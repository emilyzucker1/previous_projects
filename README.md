Projects I've built in my programming classes

Hello!

in this repository, you'll find some programs that I've built in the past. 

Some of these programs do not function on their own. Some were built to specifically meet a set of criteria given by 
an auto grader, and some must be paired with other files that contain classes and methods that are referenced in the program. 

Thanks for checking it out!
